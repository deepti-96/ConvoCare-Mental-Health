# CONVOCARE

## Introduction

This repository contains the submission for HackDuke’21 (Code-for-good) for the health track.
1. Urgent Need: University students are experiencing increasing amount of psychological distress that remain unaddressed. Suicide incidents among students is at an all-time high</br>
2. The Taboo: Students are embarrassed to talk about their feelings with counsellors</br>
3. Supply-Demand Mismatch: Students are reluctant to seek mental health counselling; while schools lack the means to monitor and cater to students’ needs</br></br>
The number of people experiencing this disorder may increase as individuals recover from the widespread isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</br>

## Proposed Solution

1. The app connects students with appropriate counseling services through a semi-monitored app for mental health in universities</br>
2. The application consists of a privacy control that allows the students to maintain a personal diary of thoughts and emotions. The dairy contents will be sentimentally analyzed on the client end and a brief report would be provided to the user indicating mental health status</br> 
3. Students can apply for counselling through the application</br>


Successfully building a word-embedding LSTM sentiment analysis model to predict if a post indicates anxiety or depression with ~70% accuracy</br>

## Future prospects

1. Transforming the university-centric application into a model based on organizations as a whole</br>
2. After considering user privacy concerns, an effective way of tracking user activity could be incorporated</br>
3. Integrating with social media platforms to spread mental health awareness, to reach out to those suffering and to normalize discussions on mental health</br>
